      <p>
      AWS offers services such as AWS Route53 and AWS Certificate Manager to set up domain names with SSL. Which are very easy to use and set up in a matter of minutes to have your website up and running in a couple of steps.
But sometimes you just don't want to incur any costs with this. Well, are there any cheaper ways to do this? Yes. And in today's article, I'll be doing a guide on how to install Let's Encrypt SSL on your web server and configure it to be used on your website for FREE! I'm using an Ubuntu 20.04 server and I'll be hosting my personal portfolio website on it. I'll also be using a domain name I acquired from .Tech Domains as part of my GitHub Student Developer Pack. Let's get started.
